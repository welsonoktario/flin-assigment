- (Part 4 -  AWS & WordPress Hosting Infrastructure)[https://github.com/welsonoktario/flin-assignment-part4]

This project was build using fully using JavaScript ecosystem, including Express.js, React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. I pick this tech stacks because it's aligned with my skills and experience and to prevent time wasting to learn new technology, like Django and Flask.

While doing this assignment, I used Google as my resources combined with my old projects and skills. The reason I can't finish Part 4 is because lack of experiences and I need more time to learn more and more about deployments and cloud computing.
